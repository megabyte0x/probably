# Probably

## Overview
A lottery game where users can buy tickets for a fixed price and have the option to invest additional money in their tickets for a higher chance of winning the prize

The game uses a random number generation mechanism to determine the winner.

The probability of winning is calculated based on:
 * Investment ratio
 * Number of tickets sold
 * Total prize money
 
 The game has a cap on the probability of winning to ensure fairness among players
 
 The funds collected from ticket sales and investments are locked for a certain period of time
 
 These funds are invested in a liquidity pool to generate returns
 
 The returns generated from the liquidity pool are added to the prize money
 
 The final pool amount is used to calculate the returns generated.
